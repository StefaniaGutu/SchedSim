# SchedSim
Process simulator that *evaluates the performance of 4 scheduling algorithms*. 

The project contains an interactive menu from which you can choose one of the following sheduling algorithms:
- First Come First Serve
- Shortest Job First
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin Scheduling

The program provides standard indicators such as CPU usage, waiting time, turn around time.

The simulator was implemented in **C++** together with [@DobreAdriana](https://github.com/DobreAdriana) and [@LucianaPirlogea](https://github.com/LucianaPirlogea).
